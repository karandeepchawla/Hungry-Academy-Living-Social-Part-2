The program is a virtual laundromat.  In this program you can purchase money cards and use them to wash clothes.  You can also check the balances of the machines if you have the administrative password.

I wrote this project because our teacher asked us to develop a laundromat in a C++ program.  He wanted us to use classes and have error checking.

It took a lot of effort, dedication, and tenaciousness. It was the first time I had written a somewhat complicated code that used classes and was proud of the outcome. Amongst the 20 students in the classroom, my project was one of the few that was fully functionally and completed the requirements of the assignment. Spending more than ten hours on this project, I learned about the benefits and caveats of developing on different compilers, which gave me different errors.  Developing the program helped me develop the tenacity it takes to sit in front of computer endlessly working away.  This made me realize potential inside myself I didnâ€™t know I had before. This project was the stepping stone in my desire to learn, create, and develop beyond my expectations.
